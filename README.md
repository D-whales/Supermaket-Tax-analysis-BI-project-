The supermarket generated $15.38k on tax with 6 product lines in the store (shown in the dashboard).
Also to note that food and beverages result in more taxes than other products.

### Customers History:
There are about 1000 customers who patronize the supermarket.
This is also on the side that Female customers pay more tax than male customers.


## Conclusion and Recommendations:
After a thorough analysis of Tax generation in the Supermarket, we have concluded that females are prone to more taxation based on the product categories they purchase which are food items and home-use products which attract more tax than others in the product groups.
Sales analysis report shows that most sales are from registered members and as well as cash is the most common mode of payment among customers.
