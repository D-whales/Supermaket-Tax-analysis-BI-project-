## Analysis:

### Tax :
The supermarket generated $15.38k on tax with 6 product lines in the store (shown in the dashboard).
Also to note that food and beverages result in more taxes than other products.

### Customers History:
There are about 1000 customers who patronize the supermarket.
This is also on the side that Female customers pay more tax than male customers.


## Conclusion and Recommendations:
Coffee and Chocolate are the most in demand at each store.
Hell's Kitchen has the highest sales and generates more revenue but just a slight difference from other stores.

#Recommendation: 
The coffee and chocolate categories should be restocked as soon as possible based on weekly sales so the store won't run out of the products,
All  should be paid more attention to for redistribution
