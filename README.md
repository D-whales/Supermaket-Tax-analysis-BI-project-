Also to note that Coffee and Chocolates have the highest sales.

### Store: 
There are 3 stores currently operating and Hell's Kitchen Store has the highest sales. 

## Conclusion and Recommendations:
Coffee and Chocolate are the most in demand at each store.
Hell's Kitchen has the highest sales and generates more revenue but just a slight difference from other stores.

#Recommendation: 
The coffee and chocolate categories should be restocked as soon as possible based on weekly sales so the store won't run out of the products,
All  should be paid more attention to for redistribution
